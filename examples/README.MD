# Example notebooks

These notebooks are designed to demonstrate the fitting of each method. The demonstrations use study data from rounds 14-to-19 of the REACT-1 prevalence survey, but can easily be adapted to fit other datasets.

The code used in these notebooks is as simple as possible. The number of external functions called is minimised to prevent the user from needing to decipher multiple layers of code.
