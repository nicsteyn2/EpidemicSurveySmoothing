# Scripts to reproduce results from the paper

Scripts are numbered by section. Interim outputs and results files are saved in the corresponding folder in ``/outputs/``. Figures are saved to ``/figures/``.

Generally, ``.jl`` files produce results from the novel methods, while ``.R`` files produce results from the Eales and Abbott methods, and also generate the figures.
