# Data

The REACT-1 data is stored in two files. ``reactdata.csv`` contains daily swabs taken, number of positive swabs, weighted prevalence (assuming survey weights are valid on a daily basis), and sum of squared weights. ``reactdata_variants.csv`` contains daily swabs taken, the total number of positive swabs, the number of swabs successfully sequenced, and the number of swabs positive for the given variant of interest.

The ``PCR-curves`` folder contains three estimates of the RT-PCR test sensitivity functions:
